# MemoryArena-Experiment

Experimental workspace derived from the MemoryArena project.

Code reference: this project references and adapts code from [ZexueHe/MemoryArena](https://github.com/ZexueHe/MemoryArena).

This project keeps the same high-level structure and components as the source repo so experiments can be developed separately without modifying the original checkout.

Base implementation: **MemoryArena: Benchmarking Agent Memory in Interdependent Multi-Session Agentic Tasks** (https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16313).

*This code is preview version. We are still actively maintaining and improving this codebase.*
## Quick Start 
**[Important]** Check `setup_web_shopping.md`, `setup_travel.md`, `setup_web_search_env.md`, and `setup_formal_reasoning.md` to follow step-by-step instructions for each test environment.

## Repository Structure

- `agent/`: task agent implementations.
- `env/`: environment server, client, and environment systems.
- `memory/`: memory client and memory systems including long-context, letta, mirix, mem0, mem0-g, ReasoningBank, BM25, Text-embedding RAG,  GraphRAG,  and MemoRAG. 

## API Keys
- Make sure you have your `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL`,  `GOOGLE_API_KEY`,  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,  `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_BASE_URL` set ready in either your bashrc file or in configs following each setup `md`.
- For Letta, Mirix, Mem0 (including Mem0-g), make sure you have their memory system api keys ready `LETTA_API_KEY`, `MIRIX_API_KEY`, `MEM0_API_KEY` in your bashrc file. 

## Example Flow

1. Task prompt → memory wraps prompt
2. Agent generates action
3. Env `step()` executes tool or accepts final
4. Observation + reward returned
5. Memory stores action/observation/reward(optional)
